 Changes
=========

1.9.1 (unreleased)
==================

- Nothing changed yet.


1.9.0 (2021-10-26)
==================

- Fix adapting base string input to plain text to behave more like 1.7
  by only running the HTML to plain text algorithm if the input looks
  like it may contain HTML markup. Note that in some instances where
  characters like '<' were previously escaped to '&lt;', this will no
  longer happen if the rest of the string doesn't look like HTML. See `issue 44
  <https://github.com/NextThought/nti.contentfragments/issues/44>`_.
- Add schema fields ``VerbatimPlainText`` and
  ``VerbatimPlainTextLine`` to assume any incoming unicode value
  already represents a plain text content fragment, instead of
  (possibly) passing it through the HTML to plain text algorithm.

1.8.0 (2021-10-06)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.9 and 3.10.
- Move to Github Actions from Travis CI.
- The algorithm for converting HTML to plain text has been changed and
  produces higher quality output. For example, links are preserved in
  a human-readable fashion. See `issue 39 <https://github.com/NextThought/nti.contentfragments/issues/39>`_.
- Fix an error getting link text when there was no link formatter
  utility installed. See `PR 42
  <https://github.com/NextThought/nti.contentfragments/pull/41#event-5422788226>`_.

1.7.0 (2020-10-07)
==================

- Allow conversion of reStructuredText fragments to plain text.


1.6.1 (2020-09-14)
==================

- Ensure disallowed tags nested within anchors do not raise.
  See `issue 34 <https://github.com/NextThought/nti.contentfragments/issues/34>`_.


1.6.0 (2020-09-02)
==================

- Add support for reStructuredText content fragments and corresponding
  fields.


1.5.0 (2020-07-23)
==================

- When sanitizing html, disable link creation when already under an anchor.


1.4.0 (2020-06-17)
==================

- Allow ``IAllowedAttributeProvider`` to be registered to provide
  additional attributes that would be allowed in sanitized content
  fragments.


1.3.0 (2020-04-06)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.8.

- Depend on zope.interface 5.0.

- Update the datrie dependency. See https://github.com/NextThought/nti.contentfragments/issues/24

- Make ``IUnicodeContentFragment`` extend
  ``zope.interface.common.collections.ISequence`` instead of the
  semi-deprecated ``zope.interface.common.sequence.IReadSequence``.

- Replace custom interfaces ``IString``, ``IUnicode`` and ``IBytes``
  with aliases for ``INativeString``, ``ITextString`` and
  ``IByteString`` from ``zope.interface.common.builtins``. These
  custom aliases are now deprecated. See https://github.com/NextThought/nti.contentfragments/issues/23.

- Fix unicode normalization breaking schema fields with zope.schema
  6.0. See https://github.com/NextThought/nti.contentfragments/issues/26

- Ensure all objects have consistent resolution orders.

1.2.1 (2019-11-07)
==================

- Remove a word from the censored word list. See issue https://github.com/NextThought/nti.contentfragments/issues/22.


1.2.0 (2018-10-15)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.7. Note that ``datrie`` is not yet
  available for Python 3.7.

- Add support for PyPy3.

- Add interfaces for all schema fields defined in
  ``nti.contentfragments.schema`` and make the respective classes
  implement them.

1.1.1 (2018-06-29)
==================

- Packaging: Do not use ``html5lib[datrie]`` and instead copy that
  dependency into our own dependencies to workaround a buildout error.
  See https://github.com/NextThought/nti.contentfragments/issues/17


1.1.0 (2017-06-14)
==================

- Remove dependency of ``dolmen.builtins``. The interfaces
  ``IUnicode``, ``IBytes`` and ``IString`` are now always defined by this package.

- Add support for Python 3.6.


1.0.0 (2016-08-19)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.
- Stop configuring plone.i18n. It's a big dependency and doesn't work
  on Python 3.
- Introduce our own interfaces for IUnicode and IString, subclassing
  dolmen.builtins.IUnicode and IString, respectively, if possible.
- The word lists used in censoring are cached in memory.
- ``nti.contentfragments.html._Serializer`` has been renamed and
  is no longer public.
- Depend on zope.mimetype >= 2.1.0 for better support of Python 3.
